# The Data Incubator
## Problem Statement:
With the lack of vaccine/effective treatment + the limited medical resources, it is critical that the spread of coronavirus be contained by social distancing. However, social distancing has been implemented with mixed effectiveness in different areas. This project aims to predict the degree to which social distancing is effectively practiced on the US county level. The usefulness of this is apparent in understanding what stops the effective practice of social distancing, where this is occuring, and how we can better support social distancing as well as identify future clusters to better prepare.

The inputs to a predictive model for the level of social distancing on a US county level will grow over time, but the current ideas involve Twitter data on a county level as well as socio-economic data on a US county level.

## 1st Asset: Inputs to the model: Twitter and socio-economic data
